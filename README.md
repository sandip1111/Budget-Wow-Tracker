Motivation Behind Project:
As a university student it is very important to be able to keep track of where I am spending my money. Many of the expense tracking websites and apps either lack functionality or in design.
I decided to create an expense tracking app that has both the functionality and the design.
This project was also a great chance for me to learn the Mantine UI library.

 Technologies used:
React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Context API

Quick Description of app:
This app includes the common expense tracking features such as a total budget and expenses counter as well as transaction history.
The user is able to reset both budget and expenses amount as well as delete a transaction. After a transaction is deleted the effect it had on the budget / expenses is undone.
Clicking on a transaction reveals more information about it as well as giving the user the ability to delete the transaction.
The app also includes the ability to categorize expenses. The user can pick out of 3 pre-existing categories or create their own.
The user is also able to view their Budget and Expenses in a pie chart to easily visualize their financial state.
